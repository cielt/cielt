sappho fragment 16 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sappho%27s_Fragment_16>
----------------------------------
οι μεν ιππηων στροτον οι δε πεσδων οι δε νᾱων φαισ' επι γᾱν μελαινᾱν εμμεναι καλλιστον εγω δε κην' οτ- τω τις ερᾱται 

Σαπφώ 
Some men say an army of horse and some men say an army on foot
and some men say an army of ships is the most beautiful thing
on this black earth. But I say it is
... what you love.

Ποταμοῖς τοῖς αὐτοῖς ἐμβαίνομέν τε καὶ οὐκ ἐμβαίνομεν, εἶμέν τε καὶ οὐκ εἶμεν.
"We both step and do not step in the same rivers. We are and are not."
